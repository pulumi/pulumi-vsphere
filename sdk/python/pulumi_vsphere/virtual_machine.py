        ## About Working with Virtual Machines in Terraform
        
        A high degree of control and flexibility is afforded to a vSphere user when it
        comes to how to configure, deploy, and manage virtual machines - much more
        control than given in a traditional cloud provider. As such, Terraform has to
        make some decisions on how to manage the virtual machines it creates and
        manages. This section documents things you need to know about your virtual
        machine configuration that you should consider when setting up virtual
        machines, creating templates to clone from, or migrating from previous versions
        of this resource.
        
        ### Disks
        
        The `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource currently only supports standard
        VMDK-backed virtual disks - it does not support other special kinds of disk
        devices like RDM disks.
        
        Disks are managed by an arbitrary label supplied to the `label`
        attribute of a `disk` block. This is separate from the
        automatic naming that vSphere picks for you when creating a virtual machine.
        Control over a virtual disk's name is not supported unless you are attaching an
        external disk with the `attach` attribute.
        
        Virtual disks can be SCSI disks only. The SCSI controllers managed by Terraform
        can vary, depending on the value supplied to
        `scsi_controller_count`. This also dictates the
        controllers that are checked when looking for disks during a cloning process.
        By default, this value is `1`, meaning that you can have up to 15 disks
        configured on a virtual machine. These are all configured with the controller
        type defined by the `scsi_type` setting. If you are cloning from
        a template, devices will be added or re-configured as necessary.
        
        When cloning from a template, you must specify disks of either the same or
        greater size than the disks in the source template when creating a traditional
        clone, or exactly the same size when cloning from snapshot (also known as a
        linked clone). For more details, see the section on creating a virtual machine
        from a template.
        
        A maximum of 60 virtual disks can be configured when the
        `scsi_controller_count` setting is configured to its
        maximum of `4` controllers. See the disk options section for
        more details.
        
        ### Customization and network waiters
        
        Terraform waits during various parts of a virtual machine deployment to ensure
        that it is in a correct expected state before proceeding. These happen when a
        VM is created, or also when it's updated, depending on the waiter.
        
        Two waiters of note are:
        
        * **The customization waiter:** This waiter watches events in vSphere to
          monitor when customization on a virtual machine completes during VM creation.
          Depending on your vSphere or VM configuration it may be necessary to change
          the timeout or turn it off. This can be controlled by the
          `timeout` setting in the customization
          settings block.
        * **The network waiter:** This waiter waits for interfaces to show up on a
          guest virtual machine close to the end of both VM creation and update. This
          waiter is necessary to ensure that correct IP information gets reported to
          the guest virtual machine, mainly to facilitate the availability of a valid,
          reachable default IP address for any [provisioners][tf-docs-provisioners].
          The behavior of the waiter can be controlled with the
          `wait_for_guest_net_timeout`,
          `wait_for_guest_net_routable`,
          `wait_for_guest_ip_timeout`, and
          `ignored_guest_ips` settings.
        
        [tf-docs-provisioners]: /docs/provisioners/index.html
        
        ### Migrating from a previous version of this resource
        
        > **NOTE:** This section only applies to versions of this resource available
        in versions v0.4.2 of this provider or earlier.
        
        The path for migrating to the current version of this resource is very similar
        to the import path, with the exception that the `terraform
        import` command does not need to be run. See that section for details on what
        is required before you run `terraform plan` on a state that requires migration.
        
        A successful migration usually only results in a configuration-only diff - that
        is, Terraform reconciles some configuration settings that cannot be set during
        the migration process with state. In this event, no reconfiguration operations
        are sent to the vSphere server during the next `terraform apply`.  See the
        importing section for more details.
        
        ## Creating a Virtual Machine from a Template
        
        The `clone` block can be used to create a new virtual machine from an existing
        virtual machine or template. The resource supports both making a complete copy
        of a virtual machine, or cloning from a snapshot (otherwise known as a linked
        clone).
        
        See the cloning and customization
        example for a usage synopsis.
        
        > **NOTE:** Changing any option in `clone` after creation forces a new
        resource.
        
        > **NOTE:** Cloning requires vCenter and is not supported on direct ESXi
        connections.
        
        The options available in the `clone` block are:
        
        * `template_uuid` - (Required) The UUID of the source virtual machine or
          template.
        * `linked_clone` - (Optional) Clone this virtual machine from a snapshot.
          Templates must have a single snapshot only in order to be eligible. Default:
          `false`.
        * `timeout` - (Optional) The timeout, in minutes, to wait for the virtual
          machine clone to complete. Default: 30 minutes.
        * `customize` - (Optional) The customization spec for this clone. This allows
          the user to configure the virtual machine post-clone. For more details, see
          virtual machine customization.
        
        ### Additional requirements and notes for cloning
        
        Note that when cloning from a template, there are additional requirements in
        both the resource configuration and source template:
        
        * The virtual machine must not be powered on at the time of cloning.
        * All disks on the virtual machine must be SCSI disks.
        * You must specify at least the same number of `disk` devices as there are
          disks that exist in the template. These devices are ordered and lined up by
          the `unit_number` attribute. Additional disks can be added past this.
        * The `size` of a virtual disk must be at least the same size as its
          counterpart disk in the template.
        * When using `linked_clone`, the `size`, `thin_provisioned`, and
          `eagerly_scrub` settings for each disk must be an exact match to the
          individual disk's counterpart in the source template.
        * The `scsi_controller_count` setting should be
          configured as necessary to cover all of the disks on the template. For best
          results, only configure this setting for the amount of controllers you will
          need to cover your disk quantity and bandwidth needs, and configure your
          template accordingly. For most workloads, this setting should be kept at its
          default of `1`, and all disks in the template should reside on the single,
          primary controller.
        * Some operating systems (such as Windows) do not respond well to a change in
          disk controller type, so when using such OSes, take care to ensure that
          `scsi_type` is set to an exact match of the template's controller set. For
          maximum compatibility, make sure the SCSI controllers on the source template
          are all the same type.
        
        To ease the gathering of some of these options, you can use the
        [`vsphere_virtual_machine` data source][tf-vsphere-virtual-machine-ds], which
        will give you disk attributes, network interface types, SCSI bus types, and
        also the guest ID of the source template.  See the cloning and customization
        example for usage details.
        
        ## Virtual Machine Migration
        
        The `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource supports live migration (otherwise known
        as vMotion) both on the host and storage level. One can migrate the entire VM
        to another host, cluster, resource pool, or datastore, and migrate or pin a
        single disk to a specific datastore.
        
        ### Host, cluster, and resource pool migration 
        
        To migrate the virtual machine to another host or resource pool, change the
        `host_system_id` or `resource_pool_id` to the manged object IDs of the new host
        or resource pool accordingly. To change the virtual machine's cluster or
        standalone host, select a resource pool within the specific target.
        
        The same rules apply for migration as they do for VM creation - any host
        specified needs to be a part of the resource pool supplied. Also keep in mind
        the implications of moving the virtual machine to a resource pool in another
        cluster or standalone host, namely ensuring that all hosts in the cluster (or
        the single standalone host) have access to the datastore that the virtual
        machine is in.
        
        ## Importing 
        
        ### Additional requirements and notes for importing
        
        Many of the same requirements for
        cloning apply to importing,
        although since importing writes directly to state, a lot of these rules cannot
        be enforced at import time, so every effort should be made to ensure the
        correctness of the configuration before the import.
        
        In addition to these rules, the following extra rules apply to importing:
        
        * Disks need to have their `label` argument assigned in a convention
          matching `diskN`, starting with disk number 0, based on each disk's order on
          the SCSI bus. As an example, a disk on SCSI controller 0 with a unit number
          of 0 would be labeled `disk0`, a disk on the same controller with a unit
          number of 1 would be `disk1`, but the next disk, which is on SCSI controller
          1 with a unit number of 0, still becomes `disk2`.
        * Disks always get imported with `keep_on_remove` enabled
          until the first `terraform apply` runs, which will remove the setting for
          known disks. This is an extra safeguard against naming or accounting mistakes
          in the disk configuration.
        * The `scsi_controller_count` for the resource is set
          to the number of contiguous SCSI controllers found, starting with the SCSI
          controller at bus number 0. If no SCSI controllers are found, the VM is not
          eligible for import. To ensure maximum compatibility, make sure your virtual
          machine has the exact number of SCSI controllers it needs, and set
          `scsi_controller_count` accordingly.
        
        After importing, you should run `terraform plan`. Unless you have changed
        anything else in configuration that would be causing other attributes to
        change, the only difference should be configuration-only changes, usually
        comprising of:
        
        * The `imported` flag will transition from `true` to `false`.
        * `keep_on_remove` of known disks will transition from
          `true` to `false`. 
        * Configuration supplied in the `clone` block, if present, will be
          persisted to state. This initial persistence operation does not perform any
          cloning or customization actions, nor does it force a new resource. After the
          first apply operation, further changes to `clone` will force a new resource
          as per normal operation.
        
        > **NOTE:** Further to the above, do not make any configuration changes to
        `clone` after importing or upgrading from a legacy version of the provider
        before doing an initial `terraform apply` as these changes will not correctly
        force a new resource, and your changes will have persisted to state, preventing
        further plans from correctly triggering a diff.
        
        These changes only update Terraform state when applied, hence it is safe to run
        when the virtual machine is running. If more settings are being modified, you
        may need to plan maintenance accordingly for any necessary re-configuration of
        the virtual machine.

               of disks you can add to the virtual machine and the maximum disk unit number.
               Note that lowering this value does not remove controllers. Default: `1`.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] scsi_type: The type of SCSI bus this virtual machine will have.
               Can be one of lsilogic (LSI Logic Parallel), lsilogic-sas (LSI Logic SAS) or

        :param pulumi.Input[float] wait_for_guest_ip_timeout: The amount of time, in minutes, to
               wait for an available guest IP address on this virtual machine. This should
               only be used if your version of VMware Tools does not allow the
               `wait_for_guest_net_timeout` waiter to be
               used. A value less than 1 disables the waiter. Default: 0.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] wait_for_guest_net_routable: Controls whether or not the guest
               network waiter waits for a routable address. When `false`, the waiter does
               not wait for a default gateway, nor are IP addresses checked against any
               discovered default gateways as part of its success criteria. This property is
               ignored if the `wait_for_guest_ip_timeout`
               waiter is used. Default: `true`.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] wait_for_guest_net_timeout: The amount of time, in minutes, to
               wait for an available IP address on this virtual machine's NICs. Older
               versions of VMware Tools do not populate this property. In those cases, this
               waiter can be disabled and the
               `wait_for_guest_ip_timeout` waiter can be used
               instead. A value less than 1 disables the waiter. Default: 5 minutes.
