/**
 * The `vsphereThumbprint` data source can be used to discover the host
 * thumbprint of an ESXi host. This can be used when adding the `vsphere.Host`
 * resource. If the host is using a certificate chain, the first one returned
 * will be used to generate the thumbprint.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const thumbprint = pulumi.output(vsphere.getHostThumbprint({
 *     address: "esxi.example.internal",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
