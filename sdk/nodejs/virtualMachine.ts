/**
 * The `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource can be used to manage the complex
 * lifecycle of a virtual machine. It supports management of disk, network
 * interface, and CDROM devices, creation from scratch or cloning from template,
 * and migration through both host and storage vMotion.
 * 
 * For more details on working with virtual machines in vSphere, see [this
 * page][vmware-docs-vm-management].
 * 
 * [vmware-docs-vm-management]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-55238059-912E-411F-A0E9-A7A536972A91.html
 * 
 * ## About Working with Virtual Machines in Terraform
 * 
 * A high degree of control and flexibility is afforded to a vSphere user when it
 * comes to how to configure, deploy, and manage virtual machines - much more
 * control than given in a traditional cloud provider. As such, Terraform has to
 * make some decisions on how to manage the virtual machines it creates and
 * manages. This section documents things you need to know about your virtual
 * machine configuration that you should consider when setting up virtual
 * machines, creating templates to clone from, or migrating from previous versions
 * of this resource.
 * 
 * ### Disks
 * 
 * The `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource currently only supports standard
 * VMDK-backed virtual disks - it does not support other special kinds of disk
 * devices like RDM disks.
 * 
 * Disks are managed by an arbitrary label supplied to the `label`
 * attribute of a `disk` block. This is separate from the
 * automatic naming that vSphere picks for you when creating a virtual machine.
 * Control over a virtual disk's name is not supported unless you are attaching an
 * external disk with the `attach` attribute.
 * 
 * Virtual disks can be SCSI disks only. The SCSI controllers managed by Terraform
 * can vary, depending on the value supplied to
 * `scsi_controller_count`. This also dictates the
 * controllers that are checked when looking for disks during a cloning process.
 * By default, this value is `1`, meaning that you can have up to 15 disks
 * configured on a virtual machine. These are all configured with the controller
 * type defined by the `scsi_type` setting. If you are cloning from
 * a template, devices will be added or re-configured as necessary.
 * 
 * When cloning from a template, you must specify disks of either the same or
 * greater size than the disks in the source template when creating a traditional
 * clone, or exactly the same size when cloning from snapshot (also known as a
 * linked clone). For more details, see the section on creating a virtual machine
 * from a template.
 * 
 * A maximum of 60 virtual disks can be configured when the
 * `scsi_controller_count` setting is configured to its
 * maximum of `4` controllers. See the disk options section for
 * more details.
 * 
 * ### Customization and network waiters
 * 
 * Terraform waits during various parts of a virtual machine deployment to ensure
 * that it is in a correct expected state before proceeding. These happen when a
 * VM is created, or also when it's updated, depending on the waiter.
 * 
 * Two waiters of note are:
 * 
 * * **The customization waiter:** This waiter watches events in vSphere to
 *   monitor when customization on a virtual machine completes during VM creation.
 *   Depending on your vSphere or VM configuration it may be necessary to change
 *   the timeout or turn it off. This can be controlled by the
 *   `timeout` setting in the customization
 *   settings block.
 * * **The network waiter:** This waiter waits for interfaces to show up on a
 *   guest virtual machine close to the end of both VM creation and update. This
 *   waiter is necessary to ensure that correct IP information gets reported to
 *   the guest virtual machine, mainly to facilitate the availability of a valid,
 *   reachable default IP address for any [provisioners][tf-docs-provisioners].
 *   The behavior of the waiter can be controlled with the
 *   `wait_for_guest_net_timeout` and
 *   `wait_for_guest_net_routable` settings.
 * 
 * [tf-docs-provisioners]: /docs/provisioners/index.html
 * 
 * ### Migrating from a previous version of this resource
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** This section only applies to versions of this resource available
 * in versions v0.4.2 of this provider or earlier.
 * 
 * The path for migrating to the current version of this resource is very similar
 * to the import path, with the exception that the `terraform
 * import` command does not need to be run. See that section for details on what
 * is required before you run `terraform plan` on a state that requires migration.
 * 
 * A successful migration usually only results in a configuration-only diff - that
 * is, Terraform reconciles some configuration settings that cannot be set during
 * the migration process with state. In this event, no reconfiguration operations
 * are sent to the vSphere server during the next `terraform apply`.  See the
 * importing section for more details.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ### Creating a virtual machine from scratch
 * 
 * The following block contains all that is necessary to create a new virtual
 * machine, with a single disk and network interface. 
 * 
 * The resource makes use of the following data sources to do its job:
 * [`vsphere_datacenter`][tf-vsphere-datacenter] to locate the datacenter,
 * [`vsphere_datastore`][tf-vsphere-datastore] to locate the default datastore to
 * put the virtual machine in, [`vsphere_resource_pool`][tf-vsphere-resource-pool]
 * to locate a resource pool located in a cluster or standalone host, and
 * [`vsphere_network`][tf-vsphere-network] to locate a network.
 * 
 * [tf-vsphere-datacenter]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/datacenter.html
 * [tf-vsphere-datastore]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/datastore.html
 * [tf-vsphere-resource-pool]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/resource_pool.html
 * [tf-vsphere-network]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/network.html
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const dc = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }));
 * const cluster = pulumi.output(vsphere.getComputeCluster({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "cluster1",
 * }));
 * const datastore = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatastore({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "datastore1",
 * }));
 * const network = pulumi.output(vsphere.getNetwork({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "public",
 * }));
 * const vm = new vsphere.VirtualMachine("vm", {
 *     datastoreId: datastore.apply(datastore => datastore.id),
 *     disks: [{
 *         label: "disk0",
 *         size: 20,
 *     }],
 *     guestId: "other3xLinux64Guest",
 *     memory: 1024,
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         networkId: network.apply(network => network.id),
 *     }],
 *     numCpus: 2,
 *     resourcePoolId: cluster.apply(cluster => cluster.resourcePoolId),
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Cloning and customization example
 * 
 * Building on the above example, the below configuration creates a VM by cloning
 * it from a template, fetched via the
 * [`vsphere_virtual_machine`][tf-vsphere-virtual-machine-ds] data source. This
 * allows us to locate the UUID of the template we want to clone, along with
 * settings for network interface type, SCSI bus type (especially important on
 * Windows machines), and disk attributes.
 * 
 * [tf-vsphere-virtual-machine-ds]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/virtual_machine.html
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Cloning requires vCenter and is not supported on direct ESXi
 * connections.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const dc = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }));
 * const cluster = pulumi.output(vsphere.getComputeCluster({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "cluster1",
 * }));
 * const datastore = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatastore({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "datastore1",
 * }));
 * const network = pulumi.output(vsphere.getNetwork({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "public",
 * }));
 * const template = pulumi.output(vsphere.getVirtualMachine({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "ubuntu-16.04",
 * }));
 * const vm = new vsphere.VirtualMachine("vm", {
 *     clone: {
 *         customize: {
 *             ipv4Gateway: "10.0.0.1",
 *             linuxOptions: {
 *                 domain: "test.internal",
 *                 hostName: "terraform-test",
 *             },
 *             networkInterfaces: [{
 *                 ipv4Address: "10.0.0.10",
 *                 ipv4Netmask: 24,
 *             }],
 *         },
 *         templateUuid: template.apply(template => template.id),
 *     },
 *     datastoreId: datastore.apply(datastore => datastore.id),
 *     disks: [{
 *         eagerlyScrub: template.apply(template => template.disks[0].eagerlyScrub),
 *         label: "disk0",
 *         size: template.apply(template => template.disks[0].size),
 *         thinProvisioned: template.apply(template => template.disks[0].thinProvisioned),
 *     }],
 *     guestId: template.apply(template => template.guestId),
 *     memory: 1024,
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         adapterType: template.apply(template => template.networkInterfaceTypes[0]),
 *         networkId: network.apply(network => network.id),
 *     }],
 *     numCpus: 2,
 *     resourcePoolId: cluster.apply(cluster => cluster.resourcePoolId),
 *     scsiType: template.apply(template => template.scsiType),
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Cloning from an OVF/OVA-created template with vApp properties
 * 
 * This alternate example details how to clone a VM from a template that came from
 * an OVF/OVA file. This leverages the resource's vApp
 * properties capabilities to
 * set appropriate keys that control various configuration settings on the virtual
 * machine or virtual appliance. In this scenario, using `customize` is not
 * recommended as the functionality has tendency to overlap.
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Neither the `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource nor the vSphere
 * provider supports importing of OVA or OVF files as this is a workflow that is
 * fundamentally not the domain of Terraform. The supported path for deployment in
 * Terraform is to first import the virtual machine into a template that has not
 * been powered on, and then clone from that template. This can be accomplished
 * with [Packer][ext-packer-io], [govc][ext-govc]'s `import.ovf` and `import.ova`
 * subcommands, or [ovftool][ext-ovftool].

 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const dc = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }));
 * const cluster = pulumi.output(vsphere.getComputeCluster({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "cluster1",
 * }));
 * const datastore = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatastore({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "datastore1",
 * }));
 * const network = pulumi.output(vsphere.getNetwork({

 * }));
 * const tempateFromOvf = pulumi.output(vsphere.getVirtualMachine({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "template_from_ovf",
 * }));
 * const vm = new vsphere.VirtualMachine("vm", {
 *     clone: {
 *         templateUuid: vsphere_virtual_machine_template_from_ovf.id.apply(id => id),
 *     },
 *     datastoreId: datastore.apply(datastore => datastore.id),
 *     disks: [{
 *         eagerlyScrub: vsphere_virtual_machine_template.disks.apply(disks => disks.0.eagerlyScrub),
 *         name: "disk0",
 *         size: vsphere_virtual_machine_template.disks.apply(disks => disks.0.size),
 *         thinProvisioned: vsphere_virtual_machine_template.disks.apply(disks => disks.0.thinProvisioned),
 *     }],
 *     guestId: vsphere_virtual_machine_template.guestId.apply(guestId => guestId),
 *     memory: 1024,
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         adapterType: vsphere_virtual_machine_template.networkInterfaceTypes.apply(networkInterfaceTypes => networkInterfaceTypes[0]),
 *         networkId: network.apply(network => network.id),
 *     }],
 *     numCpus: 2,
 *     resourcePoolId: cluster.apply(cluster => cluster.resourcePoolId),
 *     scsiType: vsphere_virtual_machine_template.scsiType.apply(scsiType => scsiType),
 *     vapp: {
 *         properties: {
 *             "guestinfo.dns.server.0": "10.0.0.10",
 *             "guestinfo.hostname": "terraform-test.foobar.local",
 *             "guestinfo.interface.0.ip.0.address": "10.0.0.100/24",
 *             "guestinfo.interface.0.name": "ens192",
 *             "guestinfo.interface.0.route.0.destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
 *             "guestinfo.interface.0.route.0.gateway": "10.0.0.1",
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Using Storage DRS
 * 
 * The `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource also supports Storage DRS, allowing the
 * assignment of virtual machines to datastore clusters. When assigned to a
 * datastore cluster, changes to a virtual machine's underlying datastores are
 * ignored unless disks drift outside of the datastore cluster. The example below
 * makes use of the [`vsphere_datastore_cluster` data
 * source][tf-vsphere-datastore-cluster-data-source], and the
 * `datastore_cluster_id` configuration setting. Note
 * that the [`vsphere_datastore_cluster`
 * resource][tf-vsphere-datastore-cluster-resource] also exists to allow for
 * management of datastore clusters directly in Terraform.
 * 
 * [tf-vsphere-datastore-cluster-data-source]: /docs/providers/vsphere/d/datastore_cluster.html
 * [tf-vsphere-datastore-cluster-resource]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/datastore_cluster.html
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** When managing datastore clusters, member datastores, and virtual
 * machines within the same Terraform configuration, race conditions can apply.
 * This is because datastore clusters must be created before datastores can be
 * assigned to them, and the respective `vsphere_virtual_machine` resources will
 * no longer have an implicit dependency on the specific datastore resources. Use
 * [`depends_on`][tf-docs-depends-on] to create an explicit dependency on the
 * datastores in the cluster, or manage datastore clusters and datastores in a
 * separate configuration.
 * 
 * [tf-docs-depends-on]: /docs/configuration/resources.html#depends_on
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const dc = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }));
 * const cluster = pulumi.output(vsphere.getComputeCluster({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "cluster1",
 * }));
 * const datastoreCluster = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatastoreCluster({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "datastore-cluster1",
 * }));
 * const network = pulumi.output(vsphere.getNetwork({
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     name: "public",
 * }));
 * const vm = new vsphere.VirtualMachine("vm", {
 *     datastoreClusterId: datastoreCluster.apply(datastoreCluster => datastoreCluster.id),
 *     disks: [{
 *         label: "disk0",
 *         size: 20,
 *     }],
 *     guestId: "other3xLinux64Guest",
 *     memory: 1024,
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         networkId: network.apply(network => network.id),
 *     }],
 *     numCpus: 2,
 *     resourcePoolId: cluster.apply(cluster => cluster.resourcePoolId),
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Creating a Virtual Machine from a Template
 * 
 * The `clone` block can be used to create a new virtual machine from an existing
 * virtual machine or template. The resource supports both making a complete copy
 * of a virtual machine, or cloning from a snapshot (otherwise known as a linked
 * clone).
 * 
 * See the cloning and customization
 * example for a usage synopsis.
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Changing any option in `clone` after creation forces a new
 * resource.
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Cloning requires vCenter and is not supported on direct ESXi
 * connections.
 * 
 * The options available in the `clone` block are:
 * 
 * * `template_uuid` - (Required) The UUID of the source virtual machine or
 *   template.
 * * `linked_clone` - (Optional) Clone this virtual machine from a snapshot.
 *   Templates must have a single snapshot only in order to be eligible. Default:
 *   `false`.
 * * `timeout` - (Optional) The timeout, in minutes, to wait for the virtual
 *   machine clone to complete. Default: 30 minutes.
 * * `customize` - (Optional) The customization spec for this clone. This allows
 *   the user to configure the virtual machine post-clone. For more details, see
 *   virtual machine customization.
 * 
 * ### Additional requirements and notes for cloning
 * 
 * Note that when cloning from a template, there are additional requirements in
 * both the resource configuration and source template:
 * 
 * * The virtual machine must not be powered on at the time of cloning.
 * * All disks on the virtual machine must be SCSI disks.
 * * You must specify at least the same number of `disk` devices as there are
 *   disks that exist in the template. These devices are ordered and lined up by
 *   the `unit_number` attribute. Additional disks can be added past this.
 * * The `size` of a virtual disk must be at least the same size as its
 *   counterpart disk in the template.
 * * When using `linked_clone`, the `size`, `thin_provisioned`, and
 *   `eagerly_scrub` settings for each disk must be an exact match to the
 *   individual disk's counterpart in the source template.
 * * The `scsi_controller_count` setting should be
 *   configured as necessary to cover all of the disks on the template. For best
 *   results, only configure this setting for the amount of controllers you will
 *   need to cover your disk quantity and bandwidth needs, and configure your
 *   template accordingly. For most workloads, this setting should be kept at its
 *   default of `1`, and all disks in the template should reside on the single,
 *   primary controller.
 * * Some operating systems (such as Windows) do not respond well to a change in
 *   disk controller type, so when using such OSes, take care to ensure that
 *   `scsi_type` is set to an exact match of the template's controller set. For
 *   maximum compatibility, make sure the SCSI controllers on the source template
 *   are all the same type.
 * 
 * To ease the gathering of some of these options, you can use the
 * [`vsphere_virtual_machine` data source][tf-vsphere-virtual-machine-ds], which
 * will give you disk attributes, network interface types, SCSI bus types, and
 * also the guest ID of the source template.  See the cloning and customization
 * example for usage details.
 * 
 * ## Virtual Machine Migration
 * 
 * The `vsphere_virtual_machine` resource supports live migration (otherwise known
 * as vMotion) both on the host and storage level. One can migrate the entire VM
 * to another host, cluster, resource pool, or datastore, and migrate or pin a
 * single disk to a specific datastore.
 * 
 * ### Host, cluster, and resource pool migration 
 * 
 * To migrate the virtual machine to another host or resource pool, change the
 * `host_system_id` or `resource_pool_id` to the manged object IDs of the new host
 * or resource pool accordingly. To change the virtual machine's cluster or
 * standalone host, select a resource pool within the specific target.
 * 
 * The same rules apply for migration as they do for VM creation - any host
 * specified needs to be a part of the resource pool supplied. Also keep in mind
 * the implications of moving the virtual machine to a resource pool in another
 * cluster or standalone host, namely ensuring that all hosts in the cluster (or
 * the single standalone host) have access to the datastore that the virtual
 * machine is in.
 * 
 * ## Importing 
 * 
 * ### Additional requirements and notes for importing
 * 
 * Many of the same requirements for
 * cloning apply to importing,
 * although since importing writes directly to state, a lot of these rules cannot
 * be enforced at import time, so every effort should be made to ensure the
 * correctness of the configuration before the import.
 * 
 * In addition to these rules, the following extra rules apply to importing:
 * 
 * * Disks need to have their `label` argument assigned in a convention
 *   matching `diskN`, starting with disk number 0, based on each disk's order on
 *   the SCSI bus. As an example, a disk on SCSI controller 0 with a unit number
 *   of 0 would be labeled `disk0`, a disk on the same controller with a unit
 *   number of 1 would be `disk1`, but the next disk, which is on SCSI controller
 *   1 with a unit number of 0, still becomes `disk2`.
 * * Disks always get imported with `keep_on_remove` enabled
 *   until the first `terraform apply` runs, which will remove the setting for
 *   known disks. This is an extra safeguard against naming or accounting mistakes
 *   in the disk configuration.
 * * The `scsi_controller_count` for the resource is set
 *   to the number of contiguous SCSI controllers found, starting with the SCSI
 *   controller at bus number 0. If no SCSI controllers are found, the VM is not
 *   eligible for import. To ensure maximum compatibility, make sure your virtual
 *   machine has the exact number of SCSI controllers it needs, and set
 *   `scsi_controller_count` accordingly.
 * 
 * After importing, you should run `terraform plan`. Unless you have changed
 * anything else in configuration that would be causing other attributes to
 * change, the only difference should be configuration-only changes, usually
 * comprising of:
 * 
 * * The `imported` flag will transition from `true` to `false`.
 * * `keep_on_remove` of known disks will transition from
 *   `true` to `false`. 
 * * Configuration supplied in the `clone` block, if present, will be
 *   persisted to state. This initial persistence operation does not perform any
 *   cloning or customization actions, nor does it force a new resource. After the
 *   first apply operation, further changes to `clone` will force a new resource
 *   as per normal operation.
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Further to the above, do not make any configuration changes to
 * `clone` after importing or upgrading from a legacy version of the provider
 * before doing an initial `terraform apply` as these changes will not correctly
 * force a new resource, and your changes will have persisted to state, preventing
 * further plans from correctly triggering a diff.
 * 
 * These changes only update Terraform state when applied, hence it is safe to run
 * when the virtual machine is running. If more settings are being modified, you
 * may need to plan maintenance accordingly for any necessary re-configuration of
 * the virtual machine.
