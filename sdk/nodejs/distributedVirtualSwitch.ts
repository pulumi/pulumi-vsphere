/**
 * The `vsphere_distributed_virtual_switch` resource can be used to manage VMware
 * Distributed Virtual Switches.
 * 
 * An essential component of a distributed, scalable VMware datacenter, the
 * vSphere Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS) provides centralized management and
 * monitoring of the networking configuration of all the hosts that are associated
 * with the switch. In addition to adding port groups (see the
 * [`vsphere_distributed_port_group`][distributed-port-group] resource) that can
 * be used as networks for virtual machines, a DVS can be configured to perform
 * advanced high availability, traffic shaping, network monitoring, and more.
 * 
 * For an overview on vSphere networking concepts, see [this
 * page][ref-vsphere-net-concepts]. For more information on vSphere DVS, see [this
 * page][ref-vsphere-dvs].

 * 
 * > **NOTE:** This resource requires vCenter and is not available on direct ESXi
 * connections.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example below demonstrates a "standard" example of configuring a
 * vSphere DVS in a 3-node vSphere datacenter named `dc1`, across 4 NICs with two
 * being used as active, and two being used as passive. Note that the NIC failover
 * order propagates to any port groups configured on this DVS and can be overridden
 * there.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const esxiHosts = config.get("esxiHosts") || [
 *     "esxi1",
 *     "esxi2",
 *     "esxi3",
 * ];
 * const networkInterfaces = config.get("networkInterfaces") || [
 *     "vmnic0",
 *     "vmnic1",
 *     "vmnic2",
 *     "vmnic3",
 * ];
 * 
 * const dc = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }));
 * const host: Output<vsphere.GETHOSTResult>[] = [];
 * for (let i = 0; i < esxiHosts.length; i++) {
 *     host.push(pulumi.output(vsphere.getHost({
 *         datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *         name: esxiHosts[i],
 *     })));
 * }
 * const dvs = new vsphere.DistributedVirtualSwitch("dvs", {
 *     activeUplinks: [
 *         "uplink1",
 *         "uplink2",
 *     ],
 *     datacenterId: dc.apply(dc => dc.id),
 *     hosts: [
 *         {
 *             devices: networkInterfaces,
 *             hostSystemId: host[0].apply(host => host.id),
 *         },
 *         {
 *             devices: networkInterfaces,
 *             hostSystemId: host[1].apply(host => host.id),
 *         },
 *         {
 *             devices: networkInterfaces,
 *             hostSystemId: host[2].apply(host => host.id),
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     standbyUplinks: [
 *         "uplink3",
 *         "uplink4",
 *     ],
 *     uplinks: [
 *         "uplink1",
 *         "uplink2",
 *         "uplink3",
 *         "uplink4",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Uplink name and count control
 * 
 * The following abridged example below demonstrates how you can manage the number
 * of uplinks, and the name of the uplinks via the `uplinks` parameter.
 * 
 * Note that if you change the uplink naming and count after creating the DVS, you
 * may need to explicitly specify `active_uplinks` and `standby_uplinks` as these
 * values are saved to Terraform state after creation, regardless of being
 * specified in config, and will drift if not modified, causing errors.
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const dvs = new vsphere.DistributedVirtualSwitch("dvs", {
 *     activeUplinks: ["tfup1"],
 *     datacenterId: vsphere_datacenter_dc.id.apply(id => id),
 *     standbyUplinks: ["tfup2"],
 *     uplinks: [
 *         "tfup1",
 *         "tfup2",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** The default uplink names when a DVS is created are `uplink1`
 * through to `uplink4`, however this default is not guaranteed to be stable and
 * you are encouraged to set your own.
