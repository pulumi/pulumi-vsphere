/**
 * > **A note on the naming of this resource:** VMware refers to clusters of
 * hosts in the UI and documentation as _clusters_, _HA clusters_, or _DRS
 * clusters_. All of these refer to the same kind of resource (with the latter two
 * referring to specific features of clustering). In Terraform, we use
 * `vsphere_compute_cluster` to differentiate host clusters from _datastore
 * clusters_, which are clusters of datastores that can be used to distribute load
 * and ensure fault tolerance via distribution of virtual machines. Datastore
 * clusters can also be managed through Terraform, via the
 * [`vsphere_datastore_cluster` resource][docs-r-vsphere-datastore-cluster].
 * 
 * [docs-r-vsphere-datastore-cluster]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/datastore_cluster.html
 * 
 * The `vsphere_compute_cluster` resource can be used to create and manage
 * clusters of hosts allowing for resource control of compute resources, load
 * balancing through DRS, and high availability through vSphere HA.
 * 
 * For more information on vSphere clusters and DRS, see [this
 * page][ref-vsphere-drs-clusters]. For more information on vSphere HA, see [this
 * page][ref-vsphere-ha-clusters].
 * 
 * [ref-vsphere-drs-clusters]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-8ACF3502-5314-469F-8CC9-4A9BD5925BC2.html
 * [ref-vsphere-ha-clusters]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-5432CA24-14F1-44E3-87FB-61D937831CF6.html
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** This resource requires vCenter and is not available on direct ESXi
 * connections.
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** vSphere DRS requires a vSphere Enterprise Plus license.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * The following example sets up a cluster and enables DRS and vSphere HA with the
 * default settings. The hosts have to exist already in vSphere and should not
 * already be members of clusters - it's best to add these as standalone hosts
 * before adding them to a cluster.
 * 
 * Note that the following example assumes each host has been configured correctly
 * according to the requirements of vSphere HA. For more information, click
 * [here][ref-vsphere-ha-checklist].
 * 
 * [ref-vsphere-ha-checklist]: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.avail.doc/GUID-BA85FEC4-A37C-45BA-938D-37B309010D93.html
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const datacenter = config.get("datacenter") || "dc1";
 * const hosts = config.get("hosts") || [
 *     "esxi1",
 *     "esxi2",
 *     "esxi3",
 * ];
 * 
 * const dc = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: datacenter,
 * }));
 * const hostsHost: Output<vsphere.GETHOSTResult>[] = [];
 * for (let i = 0; i < hosts.length; i++) {
 *     hostsHost.push(vsphere.getHost);
 * %!(EXTRA string=dc.apply(dc => vsphere.getHost({
 *         datacenterId: dc.id,
 *         name: hosts[i],
 *     })))}
 * const computeCluster = new vsphere.ComputeCluster("compute_cluster", {
 *     datacenterId: dc.id,
 *     drsAutomationLevel: "fullyAutomated",
 *     drsEnabled: true,
 *     haEnabled: true,
 *     hostSystemIds: hostsHost.map(v => v.id),
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * ## vSphere Version Requirements
 * 
 * A large number of settings in the `vsphere_compute_cluster` resource require a
 * specific version of vSphere to function. Rather than include warnings at every
 * setting or section, these settings are documented below.  Note that this list
 * is for cluster-specific attributes only, and does not include the
 * `tags` parameter, which requires vSphere 6.0 or higher across all
 * resources that can be tagged.
 * 
 * All settings are footnoted by an asterisk (`*`) in their specific section in
 * the documentation, which takes you here.
 * 
 * ### Settings that require vSphere version 6.0 or higher
 * 
 * These settings require vSphere 6.0 or higher:
 * 
 * * `ha_datastore_apd_recovery_action`
 * * `ha_datastore_apd_response`
 * * `ha_datastore_apd_response_delay`
 * * `ha_datastore_pdl_response`
 * * `ha_vm_component_protection`
 * 
 * ### Settings that require vSphere version 6.5 or higher
 * 
 * These settings require vSphere 6.5 or higher:
 * 
 * * `drs_enable_predictive_drs`
 * * `ha_admission_control_host_failure_tolerance`
 *   (When `ha_admission_control_policy` is set to
 *   `resourcePercentage` or `slotPolicy`. Permitted in all versions under
 *   `failoverHosts`)
 * * `ha_admission_control_resource_percentage_auto_compute`
 * * `ha_vm_restart_timeout`
 * * `ha_vm_dependency_restart_condition`
 * * `ha_vm_restart_additional_delay`
 * * `proactive_ha_automation_level`
 * * `proactive_ha_enabled`
 * * `proactive_ha_moderate_remediation`
 * * `proactive_ha_provider_ids`
 * * `proactive_ha_severe_remediation`
