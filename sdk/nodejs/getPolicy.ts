/**
 * The `vsphere.getPolicy` data source can be used to discover the UUID of a
 * vSphere storage policy. This can then be used with resources or data sources that
 * require a storage policy.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Storage policy support is unsupported on direct ESXi connections and
 * requires vCenter 6.0 or higher.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const policy = pulumi.output(vsphere.getPolicy({
 *     name: "policy1",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
