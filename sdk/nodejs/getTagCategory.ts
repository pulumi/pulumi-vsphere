/**
 * The `vsphere..TagCategory` data source can be used to reference tag categories
 * that are not managed by this provider. Its attributes are exactly the same as the
 * `vsphere..TagCategory` resource, and, like importing,
 * the data source takes a name to search on. The `id` and other attributes are
 * then populated with the data found by the search.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Tagging support is unsupported on direct ESXi connections and
 * requires vCenter 6.0 or higher.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const category = pulumi.output(vsphere.getTagCategory({
 *     name: "test-category",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
