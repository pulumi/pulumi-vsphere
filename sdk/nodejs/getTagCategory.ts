/**
 * The `vsphere_tag_category` data source can be used to reference tag categories
 * that are not managed by Terraform. Its attributes are exactly the same as the
 * [`vsphere_tag_category` resource][resource-tag-category], and, like importing,
 * the data source takes a name to search on. The `id` and other attributes are
 * then populated with the data found by the search.
 * 
 * [resource-tag-category]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/tag_category.html
 * 
 * > **NOTE:** Tagging support is unsupported on direct ESXi connections and
 * requires vCenter 6.0 or higher.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const vsphere_tag_category_category = pulumi.output(vsphere.getTagCategory({
 *     name: "terraform-test-category",
 * }));
 * ```
