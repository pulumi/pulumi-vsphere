/**
 * The `vsphere.getNetwork` data source can be used to discover the ID of a network in
 * vSphere. This can be any network that can be used as the backing for a network
 * interface for `vsphere.VirtualMachine` or any other vSphere resource that
 * requires a network. This includes standard (host-based) port groups, distributed
 * port groups, or opaque networks such as those managed by NSX.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const datacenter = vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc-01",
 * });
 * const network = datacenter.then(datacenter => vsphere.getNetwork({
 *     name: "VM Network",
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.id,
 * }));
 * ```
