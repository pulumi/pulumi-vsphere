/**
 * The `vsphere_network` data source can be used to discover the ID of a network
 * in vSphere. This can be any network that can be used as the backing for a
 * network interface for `vsphere_virtual_machine` or any other vSphere resource
 * that requires a network. This includes standard (host-based) port groups, DVS
 * port groups, or opaque networks such as those managed by NSX.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const datacenter = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }));
 * const net = datacenter.apply(datacenter => vsphere.getNetwork({
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.id,
 *     name: "terraform-test-net",
 * }));
 * ```
