/**
 * The `vsphere.VirtualMachine` data source can be used to find the UUID of an
 * existing virtual machine or template. Its most relevant purpose is for finding
 * the UUID of a template to be used as the source for cloning into a new
 * `vsphere.VirtualMachine` resource. It also
 * reads the guest ID so that can be supplied as well.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const datacenter = pulumi.output(vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * const template = datacenter.apply(datacenter => vsphere.getVirtualMachine({
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.id,
 *     name: "test-vm-template",
 * }, { async: true }));
 * ```
