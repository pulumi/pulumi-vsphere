/**
 * The `vsphere..VirtualMachine` data source can be used to find the UUID of an
 * existing virtual machine or template. Its most relevant purpose is for finding
 * the UUID of a template to be used as the source for cloning into a new
 * [`vsphere..VirtualMachine`][docs-virtual-machine-resource] resource. It also
 * reads the guest ID so that can be supplied as well.
 * 
 * [docs-virtual-machine-resource]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 * 
 * const datacenter = vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: "dc1",
 * });
 * const template = vsphere.getVirtualMachine({
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.id,
 *     name: "test-vm-template",
 * });
 * ```
