/**
 * The `vsphere.Folder` resource can be used to manage vSphere inventory folders.
 * The resource supports creating folders of the 5 major types - datacenter
 * folders, host and cluster folders, virtual machine folders, storage folders,
 * and network folders.
 *
 * Paths are always relative to the specific type of folder you are creating.
 * A subfolder is discovered by parsing the relative path specified in `path`, so
 * `foo/bar` will create a folder named `bar` in the parent folder `foo`, as long
 * as the folder `foo` exists.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The basic example below creates a virtual machine folder named
 * `example-vm-folder` in the default datacenter's VM hierarchy.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const datacenter = vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: vsphereDatacenter,
 * });
 * const vmFolder = new vsphere.Folder("vm_folder", {
 *     path: "example-vm-folder",
 *     type: "vm",
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.then(datacenter => datacenter.id),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example with Sub-folders
 *
 * The below example builds off of the above by first creating a folder named
 * `example-parent-vm-folder`, and then locating `example-child-vm-folder` in that
 * folder. To ensure the parent is created first, we create an interpolation
 * dependency off the parent's `path` attribute.
 *
 * Note that if you change parents (for example, went from the above basic
 * configuration to this one), your folder will be moved to be under the correct
 * parent.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vsphere from "@pulumi/vsphere";
 *
 * const datacenter = vsphere.getDatacenter({
 *     name: vsphereDatacenter,
 * });
 * const parent = new vsphere.Folder("parent", {
 *     path: "example-parent-vm-folder",
 *     type: "vm",
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.then(datacenter => datacenter.id),
 * });
 * const child = new vsphere.Folder("child", {
 *     path: pulumi.interpolate`${parent.path}/example-child-vm-folder`,
 *     type: "vm",
 *     datacenterId: datacenter.then(datacenter => datacenter.id),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * An existing folder can be imported into this resource via
 *
 * its full path, via the following command:
 *
 * [docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import vsphere:index/folder:Folder folder /default-dc/vm/example-vm-folder
 * ```
 *
 * The above command would import the folder from our examples above, the VM
 *
 * folder named `example-vm-folder` located in the datacenter named
 *
 * `default-dc`.
