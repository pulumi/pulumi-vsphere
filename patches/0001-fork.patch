 Considering a scenario where this virtual machine is of high value to the
 application or organization for which it does its work, it's been determined in
 the event of a host failure, that this should be one of the first virtual
 machines to be started by vSphere HA during recovery. Hence, it

 VM will be started before any other virtual machine in the event of host
 failure.
